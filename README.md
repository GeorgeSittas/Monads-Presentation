# Monads Presentation

In this presentation, I talked about [Monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) and their role in Functional Programming.
It is by no means an exhaustive survey on monads, but serves as a (hopefully) gentle introduction to the topic. I assumed that the reader is somewhat
familiar with Haskell, since it's what I used to demonstrate the concept, but the material should be relatively simple to follow, as no advanced
features of the language were used.

The presentation played the role of a semester-long survey project in the
[Programming Language Semantics course](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~prondo/SEMANTICS/semantics.html), which is taught by
prof. [Panagiotis Rontogiannis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~prondo/) in [DiT](https://www.di.uoa.gr/) (UoA).
