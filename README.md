# Monads Presentation

In this presentation, I talked about [Monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) and their role in Functional Programming. It is by no means an exhaustive survey, but instead serves as a (hopefully) gentle introduction to the topic. It's assumed that the reader is familiar with Haskell, since it's what I used to demonstrate the concept.

The presentation played the role of a semester-long survey project in the [Programming Language Semantics course](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~prondo/SEMANTICS/semantics.html), which is taught by prof. [Panagiotis Rontogiannis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~prondo/) in [DiT](https://www.di.uoa.gr/) (UoA).
